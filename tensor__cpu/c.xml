Most of people in my family admired my grandmother when she was
alive. She was working hard to find money to raise her 5 children and never
asked my grandfather a penny. At her age, when everybody thought that
women should stay home to take care of their children, she already went out to
have a job. Looking at my grandmother and i have my own thinking is : Men
and women are equal. If women can work like men , men have to do
housework like women. Everybody need to share responsibility in the house.
We live in twenty-first century and we must think live new people.
There are a lot of women do great jobs and are well-known. Certainly,
everybody knows Hillary Clinton, a woman, talks like political men and works
hard like them. Madona, popular singer, is more popular than most of mensingers. Go back to our science history, we saw Marie-Curie who found out the
nuclear theory and gave to our science a huge profit like other science. For
sure that all of these women have to do their housework when they have free
time.So, why women can do great work and men can't do housework???
